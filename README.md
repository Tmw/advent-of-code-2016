# Programming Challanges

This is where is save the programming challanges I've tried to solve. :)

## Advent Of Code 2016

This is my attempt at fixing all [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2016) challanges. I know, I know. Advent is quite some time ago now but what gives, it still seems like a fun challange to me. Also note that I'm new to [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) and I'm using these challanges to get familiar with it so the code is probably quite terrible ;)
