# Advent of Code 2016

This is my attempt at fixing all [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2016) challanges. i know, i know. Advent is quite some time ago now but what gives, it still seems like a fun challange to me. Also note that I'm new to [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) and I'm using these challanges to get familiar with it so the code is probably quite terrible ;)

## Challanges:
- [Day 1](https://github.com/Tmw/advent-of-code-2016/blob/master/day_1/src/main.rs)
- [Day 2](https://github.com/Tmw/advent-of-code-2016/blob/master/day_2/src/main.rs)
- [Day 3](https://github.com/Tmw/advent-of-code-2016/blob/master/day_3/src/main.rs)
